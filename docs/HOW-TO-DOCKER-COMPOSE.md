### Prerequisites
1. **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. **Project Directory**: Create a project directory containing the Docker Compose file and subdirectories for `src/dags`, `logs`, and `neo4j`.

### Understanding the Components
The Docker Compose file contains multiple services essential for an Airflow setup:
- **Airflow Services**: Includes `airflow-webserver`, `airflow-scheduler`, `airflow-triggerer`, and `flower` for Celery monitoring.
- **Database Services**: `postgres` for the main database and `redis` as the Celery broker.
- **Admin Services**: `pgadmin` for PostgreSQL database management and `neo4j` for graph database capabilities.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for PostgreSQL (`postgres-db-volume`) and Airflow logs (`logs`).

### Configuration
- **Airflow Configuration**: Environment variables under `x-airflow-common` define the Airflow configuration. Adjust these variables as per your requirements.
- **Database Credentials**: Default credentials are set for PostgreSQL (`airflow:airflow`) and Neo4j (`neo4j/admin`). Change them for production environments.
- **Ports**: Ports are exposed for webserver (8080), pgAdmin (5050), flower (5555), and Neo4j (7474, 7687). Ensure they are free or change them as needed.

### Running Airflow
1. **Start Services**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services in detached mode.
2. **Access Web Interface**:
   - Airflow webserver will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
   - pgAdmin can be accessed at `http://localhost:5050`.
   - Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474`.
   - Flower (Celery monitoring) at `http://localhost:5555`.
3. **Log In**: Use the default credentials or the ones you set to log in to these interfaces.

### Managing DAGs
- Place your DAGs in the `src/dags` directory. They will be automatically synchronized with the Airflow webserver.

### Monitoring and Logs
- Check logs in the `logs` directory for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Customization and Scaling
- Adjust the number of worker nodes and other configurations in the Docker Compose file as per your scaling needs.
- Add additional Python packages by modifying the `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS` environment variable.

### Shutting Down
- Run `docker-compose down` to stop all services. Add `--volumes` to also remove the data volumes.

### Security Considerations
- Change default passwords and user names for production deployments.
- Ensure network security for exposed ports and sensitive data.

### Troubleshooting
- Use `docker-compose logs` to view logs of all services.
- Check the health status of each service using `docker ps`.

### Updating Airflow Version
- Update the Airflow image tag in the Docker Compose file to upgrade to a newer version. Re-run `docker-compose up -d` afterward.
